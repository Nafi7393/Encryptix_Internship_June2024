# Encryptix Python Internship Tasks

Welcome to the Encryptix Python internship repository! This repository contains Python projects completed as part of the internship program at Encryptix. Below are the tasks that have been completed:

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: To-Do List Application

A To-Do List application designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. Users can create, update, and track their to-do lists either through a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).

### Task 2: Calculator

A simple calculator application with basic arithmetic operations. Users input two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and the calculator computes and displays the result.

### Task 3: Password Generator

A password generator application that creates strong and random passwords based on user specifications. Users can specify the length and complexity of the password, and the application generates and displays the password on the screen.

### Task 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

A classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors where users compete against the computer. The user chooses rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer generates a random choice. The application determines the winner based on the game rules (rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock) and displays the result.

### Task 5: Contact Book

A contact management application that stores contact information including name, phone number, email, and address. Users can add, view, search, update, and delete contacts. The application provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the contact list.
